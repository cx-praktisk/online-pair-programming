Online pair programming
=======================
_Workshop on online pair programming, using VS Code Live Share._


Installation Guide
------------------
_To partake in the workshop, you'll need to have the .NET Core 3.1 SDK, and VS Code with the C# and Live Share extensions._

### .NET Core 3.1 SDK
_If you already have .NET Core installed, you can check the version with `dotnet --version`._

You can get .NET Core from the [.NET Core SDK download page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Just follow the instructions for your operating system, and you should be all set.

### VS Code with C# and Live Share extensions
C# can be edited in a number of different editors and IDE's, but since we'll be relying on VS Code Live share in this workshop, you'll have to use VS Code. You can grab a copy of VS Code from the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To make it a little bit easier to work with C#, you also want to get the [C# extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).

Finally you need to get the [Live Share extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare). In order to use Live Share, you'll also need a GitHub or Microsoft account. If you don't have either, it's quite easy to [create a new GitHub account](https://github.com/join).


The Word Chains Puzzle
----------------------
_The Word Chains Puzzle is adapted from [codekata.com](http://codekata.com/kata/kata19-word-chains/)._

Thereâ€™s a type of puzzle where the challenge is to build a chain of words, starting with one particular word and ending with another. Successive entries in the chain must all be real words present in a dictionary, and each can differ from the previous word by just one letter. For example, you can get from "CAT" to "DOG" using the following chain:

```
CAT -> COT -> COG -> DOG
```

You can get from "LEAD" to "GOLD" in four steps:

```
LEAD -> LOAD -> GOAD -> GOLD
```

In addition you can get from "RUBY" to "CODE" in six steps:

```
RUBY -> RUBS -> ROBS -> RODS -> RODE -> CODE
```

The objective of this puzzle is to write a function that finds a word chain between two words, using words from a dictionary.

### Where should we start?
It's a good idea to start by writing a function that finds the distance between two words. I.e. the distance between "ABBA" and "ALBA" is 1, since we have to change one letter to turn "ABBA" into "ALBA".

[FindWordChains.cs](WordChains/FindWordChains.cs) declares the function `int DistanceTo(this string word, string anotherWord)`, that can be used as a starting point. A unfinished set of tests for this function is supplied in [WhenPairProgramming.cs](WordChains.Test/WhenPairProgramming.cs).

### Where should we end up?
You might need more supporting functions than just `DistanceTo(...)`, but in the end you should be able to implement `IEnumerable<string> FindWordChain(this IEnumerable<string> dictionary, string fromWord, string toWord, int withDistance = 1)` in [FindWordChains.cs](WordChains/FindWordChains.cs). When you think you got the implementation working, you ca try to run the verification tests in [WhenUsingNorwegianScrabbleFederationDictionary.cs](WordChains.Test/WhenUsingNorwegianScrabbleFederationDictionary.cs). Just remove the "skip" options as described in the tests.

It's totally fine to just skip handling the optional `withDistance` parameter until you have a working solution for `withDistance = 1`.

### What should we do if we have additional time?
For added programming fun, try to return the shortest word chain that solves each puzzle. You can also have a look at optimizing your code, so you can find word chains faster.


Testing and running WordChains
------------------------------
Testing and running WordChains can be performed from the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) in VS Code. To open it, start by opening the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-palette) by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`. Search for "integrated terminal" and select "View: Toggle Integrated Terminal".

![Integrated Terminal](Images/integrated-terminal.png)

### Testing
From the integrated terminal, navigate to the folder `/WordChains.Test`, and run `dotnet test`. This will run all tests in the test-project once.

```shell
$ WordChain.Test> dotnet test

...

Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 6
     Passed: 3
    Skipped: 3
 Total time: 1.2184 Seconds
```

If you wish to re-run tests whenever a file is saved, you can use `dotnet watch test`.

```shell
$ WordChain.Test> dotnet watch test
watch : Started

...

Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 7
     Passed: 3
    Skipped: 4
 Total time: 1.2476 Seconds
watch : Exited
watch : Waiting for a file to change before restarting dotnet...
```

Press `Ctrl+C` if you want to stop watching files and running tests.

### Running the console application
The WordChains application, is a console application that can be executed from the integrated terminal. Navigate to the `/WordChains` folder, and run `dotnet run`. This will launch the application, and display information about the different options and parameters used.

```shell
$ WordChain> dotnet run
WordChains 1.0.0
Copyright (C) 2020 WordChains

ERROR(S):
  A required value not bound to option name is missing.

  -f, --from                  (Default: ABER) The word you want to start the word chain with.

  -t, --to                    (Default: ABBA) The word you want to end the word chain with.

  -d, --distance              (Default: 1) The distance, i.e. the number of letters that differ, between
                              each word in the word chain.

  --help                      Display this help screen.

  --version                   Display version information.

  dictionary file (pos. 0)    Required. A dictionary file, containing a collection of words, with one
                              single word on every line.
```

The WordChains applications requires a dictionary file, and a _from_ and _to_ word to find a chain between. To supply these arguments, we need to add `--` after the `dotnet run` command. Then we can supply a path to the dictionary file, and the `-f` and `-t` options.

```shell
$ WordChain> dotnet run -- ../norwegian-scrabble-federation-dictionary.txt -f abba -t aber
Found word chain from ABBA to ABER!
  Chain length: 33
  Word chain: ABBA -> ALBA -> ALFA -> ALKA -> AKKA -> AKKE -> AKME -> AKNE -> AGNE -> AGNA -> AGGA -> ANGA -> ANDA -> ANDE -> ANGE -> ALGE -> ALGI -> ANGI -> ANGL -> ANAL -> APAL -> ASAL -> ATAL -> AVAL -> AVAR -> AFAR -> AGAR -> AGAM -> AGAT -> AGET -> AGEN -> AGER -> ABER
```

_NB: When starting out, you wont be able to find any word chains using the console application. This is because we haven't implemented any code for finding word chains yet._

Some C# Tips
------------
_Below is some sample code, illustrating a bit of Linq, and how you migth turn a string into an array of letters. Have a loot at the [C# Programming Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/) for more tips._

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
					
public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		var numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };

		var newNumbers = numbers;
		// var newNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n > 3);
		// var newNumbers = numbers.Select(n => n + 2);
		
		// var otherNumbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
		// var newNumbers = numbers.Zip(otherNumbers, (n, m) => n + m);

		Console.WriteLine($"The new numbers are: {string.Join(", ", newNumbers)}");
		
		// var letters = "Hei igjen alle sammen".ToCharArray();
		// Console.WriteLine($"The letters are: {string.Join(", ", letters)}");
	}
}
```
